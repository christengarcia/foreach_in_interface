# foreach_in_interface

This C# program implements for-each in Inteface. It demonstrates the best practice for iterating a custom collection by implementing the IEnumerable and IEnumerator interfaces. In this code, members of these interfaces are not explicitly called, but they are implemented to support the use of foreach to iterate through the collection.
